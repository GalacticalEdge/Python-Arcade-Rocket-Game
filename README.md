# Python Arcade Rocket Game
A simple game made in Python Arcade where the player dodges asteroids.

# Why did I upload this?
I made game for a computer science class project, and I feel like this shows the best of my efforts. This is why I thought about uploading this to Github.

# Will I ever update this?
I'm not sure about that, but if I feel like I could make additional improvements to this project, then I probably will.
